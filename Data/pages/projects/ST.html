        Stolen Timelines is a fast paced platformer, where you play as a thief from the future, stealing artefacts from the past in order to meet the gang quota.
        <br>
        <br>
        Taking from a wide range of games like Lethal Company and Battle Block Theatre, we developed the game with the focus on being easy to pick up and fast paced gameplay.
        <br>
        <br>
        You will find yourself in Victorian London, locating and stealing all kinds of artefacts. All while dodging traps such as the Iron Maiden that traps and impales you with sharp spikes,
         Brazen Bull rooms which will slowly cook you alive and deadly rats running about the rooms.
        <br>
        Time is not your friend, you only have two minutes to get in and extract before being left behind.
