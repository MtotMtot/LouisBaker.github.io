        This project explored how games handle online play, focusing on networking – which network architecture is best for small-scale games and development and which API best fits the network type.
        <br />
        <br />
        The outcome consits of a basic, playable prototype in Unity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Within the game players can move, shoot and kill other players that have joined their server.
